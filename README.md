# is2-frontend
New version of IS2 frontend, implemented using Vue

## Environment setup
In order to start working on IS2 frontend, you should install:
1. [Visual studio code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In order to test if node.js has been succesfully installed in your machine, open your favorite shell and run:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
It is also important to add the following extensions to Visual studio code:
1. Vetur: an extension designed for Vue
2. ESLint: an extension that enables javascript eslint. [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) finds and fixes problems in our javascript code :)
