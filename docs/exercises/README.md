# is2-frontend exercises
Dear developers @renzo80, @francescoamato, @papizzo, @smacone, below you will find the list of exercises that should help you mastering Vue.js.

Before starting implementing your exercises, I would suggest to study the code available in [iais frontend repo](https://github.com/parstat/iais-frontend). 

Further you should be aware of a set of Vue.js core concepts:
1. [Vue components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html)
2. [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
3. [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
4. [Axios](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-make-http-requests-like-a-pro-with-axios/)

## Business service CRUD (@renzo80)
1. Business service list (static, http)
2. Business service add (http)
3. Business service edit (http)
4. Business service view (http)
5. Business service delete (http)

We will start working on **exercise 1 static**. @renzo80 you should implement a component that has a data property with a static list of business services. Such list will be displayed in a table, each table row will contain two links (edit, delete).
